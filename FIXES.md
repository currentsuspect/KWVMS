# KWVMS Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Logout Functionality
The admin dashboard was missing a logout button. This has been fixed by:
- Adding a logout button to the admin.html page header
- Implementing the logout functionality in admin.js

### 2. Order Management Issues
Vendors were unable to accept orders due to restrictive Firestore security rules. This has been fixed by:
- Modifying the Firestore security rules to be more flexible with field updates
- Changing `.hasOnly([...])` to `.hasAny([...])` for order updates to allow properties to be updated
- Improving the `acceptOrder()` function in vendor-dashboard.js with better error handling and logging

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Admin Logout**:
   - Navigate to the Admin Dashboard (admin.html)
   - Click the new Logout button in the top-right corner
   - You should be redirected to the login page

2. **Vendor Order Acceptance**:
   - Login as a vendor
   - Navigate to the Vendor Dashboard (vendor-dashboard.html)
   - Set yourself as Available using the toggle
   - Try to accept an order from the "Available Orders" list
   - The order should now be accepted successfully
   - Check your "My Orders" section to see the newly accepted order

## Firestore Rules Deployment

The updated Firestore rules need to be deployed to take effect. You need the Firebase CLI to deploy them:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy only the Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
