# Development Log - Kajiado Water Vending Management System (KWVMS)

## 2024-07-27

*   **Project Setup:** Initialized project structure (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`, `images/`, `DEVLOG.md`, `README.md`).
*   **Technology Stack Decision:** Confirmed stack:
    *   Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
    *   Backend/Database: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting)
    *   Maps: Leaflet.js
*   **Reasoning:** Focus on core web fundamentals, leverage Firebase BaaS for simplified backend/DB management suitable for a diploma project, use Leaflet for free map integration. All chosen technologies have generous free tiers.

## 2024-07-27 (Continued)

*   **Data Model Design (Firestore):** Defined the following Firestore collections and document structures:
    *   **`users`**: Stores buyer information (name, email, phone, address, createdAt). Document ID = Firebase Auth UID.
    *   **`vendors`**: Stores vendor information (name, email, phone, status, currentLocation, availability, rating, totalDeliveries, createdAt, approvedAt). Document ID = Firebase Auth UID.
    *   **`orders`**: Stores order details (userId, vendorId, quantityLiters, deliveryLocation, pricePerLiter, totalPrice, status, orderCreatedAt, acceptedAt, completedAt, userRating, userReview). Document ID = Auto-generated.
    *   **`complaints`**: Stores user complaints (userId, orderId, vendorId, complaintText, status, createdAt, resolvedAt). Document ID = Auto-generated.
*   **Relationships:** Orders link to users and vendors via their respective UIDs. Complaints can link to orders, users, and vendors.
