Project Description: Kajiado Water Vending Management System
Overview

This system is designed to facilitate water delivery in Kajiado using vendors who transport water via donkeys. The platform connects users (buyers) who need water, vendors (donkey water carriers) who deliver it, and an admin who manages orders, users, and vendors.
